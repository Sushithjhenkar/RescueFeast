            <h1 style="color: #a1a8ae">Welcome to the Food Waste Management System!</h1>
            <p style="color: #a1a8ae"> Our system is designed to facilitate the efficient management of surplus food by connecting donors with volunteers. Through our platform, donors can easily donate excess food items, while volunteers can find opportunities to redistribute this food to those in need, thereby reducing food waste and helping to alleviate hunger in our community.</p>
            <p style="color: #a1a8ae">Our mission is to reduce food waste and hunger in our community by providing a seamless platform for food donation and redistribution. We believe that no food should go to waste when there are people in need, and we are committed to making a positive impact on both the environment and society.</p>

            <h2 style="color: #a1a8ae">How It Works</h2>
             <p style="color: #a1a8ae">- Donors: Simply sign up and list the surplus food items you wish to donate. Volunteers will then be notified of available donations in their area.</p>
            <p style="color: #a1a8ae">- Volunteers: Sign up and browse available donations in your area. Once you find a donation that matches your availability, you can arrange for pickup and delivery to those in need.</p>
